- In Spring Boot, **starters** are pre-configured dependency modules designed to simplify the setup of a Spring application by bundling commonly used libraries and dependencies for specific use cases. They save developers from having to manually find, add, and configure dependencies, making application development faster and easier.
- Spring Boot Starter Parent provides default configurations for our applications such as Configuration, Dependency Management, Source Encoding and Default Plugins, Default Java Versions and Resource Filtering.
- Spring Boot Starter Web uses Spring MVC, Rest and Tom Cat as default Server and auto configures things related to development like Dispatcher Servlet, Error Page, Web Jars for managing static dependencies and Embedded Servlet Container.
