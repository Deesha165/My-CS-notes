- it helps to intercept method invocation and perform processing before and after execution
- used during logging, transaction management and security
- helps in reusability and maintainability of code
- @Aspect tells spring that this is aspect class contains some methods needs to be intercepted
- Advice is the logic that want to be applied in aspect
- Pointcut is an expression tells where an advice should be applied
- types of pointcut
   - execution: matches particular method in particular class
   - within: matches all methods within any class or package
   - @within: matches all methods in a class that have specific annotation
   - @annotation: matches all methods that have specific annotation
   - Args: matches any method with specific arguments
   - @Args: matches any method that has parameters and this parameter class is annotated with given annotation
   - target: matches any method on a particular instance of a class
   - 
- wild card * matches 1 or more items 
- .. matches 0 or more items
- @Around = @Before + @After
- AOP workflow:
   -> application start -> look for @Aspect annotation classes -> parse the pointcut expression (done by PointcutParser.java) -> stored in efficient data structure or cache -> look for @Component, @Service@Controller .. etc annotation classes -> for each class it checks if it is eligible for interception based on pointcut expression (done by AbstractAutoProxy.java) -> if yes it creates a proxy using JDK dynamic proxy this proxy has code which executes advice before the advice
