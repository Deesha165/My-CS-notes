- - The **persistence context** is a part of JPA/Hibernate that keeps track of all the entities that are being managed within a transaction.
- Any changes you make to these entities (e.g., updating a field or deleting an object) are stored in memory and not immediately reflected in the database.
- These changes remain in the persistence context until either:
    - A **flush** happens.
    - The transaction commits.
- **Flush**: Synchronizes the persistence context with the database by executing SQL for pending changes.
- **When it Happens**:
    - Automatically (before queries or commits) or manually (via `flush()`).
- **Why It's Important**:
    - Ensures data consistency between the in-memory state and the database.
    - Provides control over when changes are sent to the database without committing the transaction.
- Remember : No commit, No persistence.
- Flush is responsible for synchronizing memory and database but it still needs to commit these changes to persist.
