### **1. Transaction with `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`**

This is optimized for read-only operations.

#### **Behind the Scenes:**

1. **Spring's Transaction Manager**:
    
    - Marks the transaction as read-only.
    - Signals the persistence provider (like Hibernate) that no write operations should be performed.
2. **Hibernate (or JPA Provider)**:
    
    - **Persistence Context**:
        - A persistence context is still created, but it is optimized to prevent dirty-checking of entities. Hibernate will skip tracking entity changes, which reduces overhead.
    - **No Flush**:
        - Hibernate avoids flushing the persistence context to the database, as no modifications are expected.
        - Even if you modify entities, these changes will not be synchronized with the database.
3. **Database**:
    
    - Some databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) may optimize read-only transactions by:
        - Reducing locking overhead.
        - Skipping transaction logs (since no changes are expected).
    - The behavior depends on the database driver and configuration. For instance, MySQL honors read-only transactions at the connection level.

#### **What Happens on Write Attempt?**

- **Spring/Hibernate**: If a write operation is attempted (e.g., `save` or `update`), Spring may throw an exception or silently ignore the operation.
- **Database**: If a write is attempted and the database enforces read-only transactions, it will throw an exception (e.g., "Cannot execute statement in read-only transaction").

### **2. Transaction with `@Transactional(readOnly = false)`**

This is the default setting, used for read/write operations.

#### **Behind the Scenes:**

1. **Spring's Transaction Manager**:
    
    - Starts a read/write transaction.
    - Allows all operations, including inserts, updates, and deletes.
2. **Hibernate (or JPA Provider)**:
    
    - **Persistence Context**:
        - Hibernate tracks all entities loaded in the persistence context.
        - Performs **dirty checking**: compares the initial state of each entity with its current state to detect changes.
    - **Flushing**:
        - Hibernate automatically flushes changes to the database before the transaction commits.
        - Flushing involves executing the necessary `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements.
3. **Database**:
    
    - The database handles the transaction as read/write.
    - It applies locks, maintains transaction logs, and ensures durability (e.g., by writing to logs).
