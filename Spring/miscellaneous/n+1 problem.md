- The **N+1 problem** is a performance issue that occurs when a system performs unnecessary and inefficient database queries while loading related entities. It typically arises when using **lazy loading** in an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework like Hibernate or JPA.
#### Strategies to avoid N+1 problem:

- **Using `@EntityGraph`**: By explicitly specifying which related entities should be fetched eagerly, you reduce the need for additional queries for each entity.
    
    - Example: Instead of loading all `Departments` one-by-one, you can load them all at once along with their `Employees` and `Addresses` by using an entity graph or a join.
- **Using `@BatchSize`**: This can optimize lazy loading for collections. Instead of executing separate queries for each individual collection, you can load them in batches (e.g., 10 items at a time), which reduces the number of database round trips.
    
- **DTO projections**: Instead of loading entire entities and their relationships (which could result in N+1 queries), you can select only the fields you need. This is a more efficient way to load data, particularly when you donâ€™t need all the entity fields or when the entity has deep relationships.
