- In this attacker manipulates sql query by inserting malicious input into the user field
- like : "select *from  user_details where user_name=' "name "+ ' ' " ;
-  if name =' OR '1' ='1',this would be user_name=' ' OR '1' ='1'
- so it fetches all data from db 
- how to protect from sql injection ? 
   - by using parametrized query
🔑 **Key Idea Behind Parameterized Queries**

A **parameterized query** separates **SQL code** from **data values**. Instead of embedding data directly into the query string (which allows malicious input to become part of the SQL logic), it uses **placeholders** and **safely binds values later**, preventing them from being interpreted as SQL code.

### 💣 What Happens Without Parameters (Vulnerable to SQL Injection)

Let's say you write this vulnerable code in raw SQL:



`string query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "'";`

If `userInput = "' OR '1'='1"`, the resulting SQL is:


`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'`

This returns **all rows**, because `'1'='1'` is always true. The malicious input **changed the logic of your SQL**.

### ✅ What Happens With Parameterized Queries (Safe)

Using a parameterized query:

`string query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = @username"; command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@username", userInput);`

Now, even if `userInput = "' OR '1'='1"`, it's passed **as a value**, **not code**. The database knows it's just a string — it **doesn’t parse it as part of the SQL logic**. So it searches for a username literally equal to `"' OR '1'='1"` — likely finding nothing.

### 🧠 Summary

**Parameterized queries are safe because:**

- SQL and data are handled separately.
    
- The database treats input values **only as values**, never as executable SQL.
    
- Malicious input **cannot change the structure or logic** of the query.
    


When you use **parameterized queries**, the database engine treats the values you provide as **literal data**, not as part of the SQL syntax. That means:

- `' OR 1=1 --` is treated as **just a string**, not a dangerous SQL command.
    
- The query structure is **compiled separately** from the values, so those values can’t interfere with the query logic.

### 🔍 A Simple Analogy:

Think of SQL like filling out a form:

- **Parameterized Query**:  
    You give the form and **fill in the blanks**. The form structure is fixed — the blanks are for data only.  
    So even if someone writes dangerous words in a blank, it's just treated as **words**, not a command.
    
- **Non-Parameterized (String Concatenation)**:  
    You let someone write the **whole form**, including logic. If they sneak in malicious content, you’ll execute it blindly.
