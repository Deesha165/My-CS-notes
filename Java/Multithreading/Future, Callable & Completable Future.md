- what is Future? 
   - it is interface represents the result or status of async task 
   - allow you to take care if computation is complete, Get the result and if exception occured
- what is difference between Runnable and Callable?
   - both are interfaces to represent the task to being executed but Runnable has no return type unlike Callable
- Completable Future introduced in java8 and helps in async programming and it is advanced version of future introduced chaining
- thenApply() is synchronous operation means that second chained task would handled by same thread of the first
- thenApplyAsync() is asynchronous version
- they both doesn't gurantee order of execution
- thenCompose and thenComposeAsync gurantee dependency in chaining
