- Generics works only with Reference types
- Generic Types Differ Based on Their Type Arguments
- The ability to create type-safe code in which type-mismatch errors are caught at compile time is a key advantage of generics.
- Generics prevent from type casting because we know the type of the class unlike Object
- Raw generic type: use of generic without specifying type arguments.
