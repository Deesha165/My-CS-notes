- java is platform independent language has advantage of portability (write once, run everywhere)
- java program -> through compiler-> byte code-> through JVM-> machine code -> read by CPU and return output
- JVM is abstract machine transform byte code into machine code and it is platform dependent unlike java program itself
- JVM is an abstraction layer between Java code and the underlying operating system.
- JRE: Java Runtime Environment -> JVM + class libraries
- JDK: Java Development Kit ->JRE+( programming language+ compiler+ debugger)
- JVM ,JDK,JRE are platform dependent
