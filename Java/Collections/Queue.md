- interface and child of collection interface
- It follows FIFO approach 
- Priority Queue arrange based on priority default is minimum
- Time complexity: Add and Offer: O(log N)
- Peak: O(1)
- Poll and Remove head element O(log N)
- Comparator and Comparable both provides a way to sort collections
- Sorting algorithm uses compare method of comparator to sort elements
- Comparator is functional interface with method Compare(T x, T y)
- Comparable provide method CompareTo(T x) 
- swap in sorting occurs when value returned>0 
- What is difference between Comparable and Comparator?
  - Comparator provides flexibility in sorting criteria if we have differet situations and want to compare based on different properties
  - Comparable is used when sorting logic is fixed so we provide it into the class itself by implementing the Comparable interface
- Dequeue is double ended queue
