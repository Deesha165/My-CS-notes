- interface represents set collections
- HashSet: depend on HashMap internally as key is given and dummy object value inside so it doesn't maintain order
- LinkedHashSet: depend on LinkedHashMap internally so it maintain insertion order but doesn't maintain access order because internally access order variable is set to false when instantiating LinkedHashMap
- TreeSet: depend on TreeMap internally so all operations in O(log(N))
