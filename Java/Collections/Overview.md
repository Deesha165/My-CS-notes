- why we need collection framework ?
   - there is no common interface so it is difficult to remember the methods for each 
- Iterable used to traverse the collection and it is parent for all iterable collections
- what is difference between collection and collections?
  -  Collection is interface expose various methods implemented by various classes such as ArrayList, HashSet
  - but Collections is utility class help us to operate on collections such as swap, copy, reverse, searching, sort
