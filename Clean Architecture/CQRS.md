 In the **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** pattern:

- **Commands** are used for **writing** operations. They represent actions that change the state of the system, such as creating, updating, or deleting records.
- **Queries** are used for **reading** operations. They retrieve data from the system without modifying its state.
